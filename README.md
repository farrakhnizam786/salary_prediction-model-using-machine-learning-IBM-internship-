Salary Prediction Model - Machine Learning Project
🚀 Predict Salaries with Machine Learning!

This repository contains a Salary Prediction Model built using Machine Learning in Google Colab. The model predicts salaries based on features like experience, job role, education, and more.

📌 Key Features
✔ Machine Learning Model – Trained on a salary dataset using Linear Regression (or other algorithms).
✔ Google Colab Integration – Easy-to-run Jupyter Notebook with step-by-step execution.
✔ Data Preprocessing – Handles missing values, categorical encoding, and feature scaling.
✔ Model Evaluation – Metrics like R2 Score, MAE, RMSE to assess performance.
✔ Deployment-Ready – Can be exported for use in web apps (Flask/Django) or APIs.

🛠 Technologies Used
Python

Scikit-learn (Linear Regression, Random Forest, etc.)

Pandas & NumPy (Data Manipulation)

Matplotlib/Seaborn (Data Visualization)

Google Colab (Cloud-Based Execution)
